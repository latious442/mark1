            <h3>
                "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood.And sorry I couldn't travel both".Doesn't life sound like this lyrics?At the turning point of life,after choosing one,we can't another one.History,revolution,modernity & invention always makes us fumble whenever we think of career since we abound with quite a number of opportunities created by these stuffs.Generally speaking,most people choose their occupations after they passed the academic test.When it comes to jobs,we have two potions briefly at this moment.The first thing offer us income and the second one the moment of joy.
                 According to the survey,people who choose their beloved one as a job are mostly born with golden plate and silver spoon.From this point,they do not have to desperately chase the butterfly of money.They just need to build the garden which the butterfly of money want.With enthusiasm,they can obtain their prime version and reach the summit of success by immersing in what they love to do by trying to be better and better.People take up careers which have potential for them to earn so much outcome as far as they attempt,craving for the prosperity.Opposed to the previous one,almost of all of them suffered from the poverty.So,money is the second god of this ear and the thing to measure one's glory.Moreover,all well-paid jobs are not the ladders for richness,all ladders for richness are well-paid jobs.Even if you are indifferent at this,it will be worthy as it can bring so much comfort to you ,like the lyrics of eye of the tiger-"your trade passion for glory".
              Like the universal truth,not only does everything have bright side ,but everything also has dark side.To simplify,if you decided to go on walking on the way that you wanted to take up ,the warranty of prospect for you would live upon the situation and state in which you abide.For instance,despite technological career is  well-paid in industry-developed countries,it is not in still-developing countries.Contrasting to this, profitable jobs are not;but really mundane.At least,some hard moments in both choices makes you downhearted.For opting the beloved one,you might wake up with the poverty ;for  money,you with the regret for not risking .To be honest,rather than this painful feeling,I love to stay with the debt ,being able to build my identity and not having to care of people's view on me.I am sure everyday  will be filled with adventurous chapters and have a fun with the  roller coaster of life with the slogan,"No risk,no story.Don't need to fly high,just keep flying ".
