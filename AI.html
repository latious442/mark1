                Al:Artificial intelligence is a super program in which many functions and data are filled.Unknowingly,we use things what belongs to AI from dawn to dusk.Speaking of a brief detail all the way to ,it was industrial revolutions that are turning points for the existence of AI.Only then was AI devised and developed by geniuses of the scientific era.So far,due to its fabulous progress ,the fame of AI are getting more and more popular.Nonetheless,its popularity makes humans confused since AI can threat many careers in spite of being precise,consistent,budget-friendly.
                 For a start,the replacement of AI in some occupational areas are incontrovertible.Take Tesla company.Electric cars manufactured by Tesla are powered by AI to drive automatically as well as manually.As a certain outcome for customers,there will be no more devoting their very  valuable  time to driving cars not only whenever but also wherever  they want to
           go or feel like having a pleasant vacation.Despite of being time-saving,this advantageous fact might convey the curtain to block the light of drivng-career.Besides,the arrival of up-to-date chatGPT and search engines offers us umpteen opportunities to take up what we prefer to learn in the silhouette of our flat by clicking keyboard.Conversely,not only might Al replace in the place of teacher,but it can also give nitty-gritty effectively and efficiently.What is more,AI enables CEOs calm as using AI can vividly reduce wages ;boost the production-rate.A couple of decades ago,many CEOs were sued to for pushing their employees to do dangerous-dirty-difficult jobs whenever their employees ran into trouble.
                     In the end,even though AIs are almost flawless,they have constraints up to a point.Being based on memorization,theories,patterns and rhythms,the threat of AI to us relies on which occupation we choose.To invade some artistic fields like ghostwriting,painting,most Als have some issues to perform those broad fields.Therefore,in my opinion,the redundancy forced by Al are few and far between in spite of superior to humans at this moment.
