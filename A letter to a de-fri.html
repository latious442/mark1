My dear KoKo,</h3>
<h3>
     How have you been?For me, all goes well with me.The day when we last met is like yesterday.Isn't it?Within a close of my eye,everything was changed .My brother,our friends broke your news to me.No sooner had I heard of your news than I  became petrified.The case is that your lovely angel broke your golden heart.
   To be honest,I really sorry for your miserable  fallen relationship.As we are composed of the blood and bones,we sometimes mourn .Seriously,do I understand your emotion.Being lovelorn is a problem but not a big one ,bro.Yet,The big one is the birth of depression .I was astounded  when a mature person like you was down .No matter how painful is this,we have to keep going.Factually,you are not the only one whose heart is broken in this world.By the way,most of our friends in my town are doing as blue-collars so as to earn money.Although we were not born with golden plate and silver spoon,we can get what we want to some extent effortlessly.But,nothing lasts forever .Do you know what I mean?We can't reckon that our possessions won't disappear one day.The only thing that can be with us is the wisdom.With the aid of the destiny,the most things that we  currently have is the time.Time flies too fast.But we can manipulate and manage our own time.I mean that we can learn and study foreign languages ,new fields that catch our interest.To heal your heart and build your prime version,you should do something like reading,playing game,etc.In my opinion,the best for you is learning something as far as you can .This is because we are in the comfort zone while most are fighting for life and struggling with financial matter. I wanna tell you  the slogan of the last hope movie,"Do or Don't.There is no try".I hope one day you would be aware of this .
   Don't  make yourself bitter,my brother.Also,don't let your rage and    hatred close your eyes.Never miss the dinner time with your family!If not,one day,you might crave for that moment regretfully.I wish may I advie are beneficial for you.Anyway,I hope you get this ,man.Hit me back,just to chat.</h3>
                                     <h3 style="text-align: end;">    Truly yours, </br>
                                                BoBo.
