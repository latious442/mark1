<h3> dear NyoNyo,</br>
    
           How are your days in Mandalay?I hope all goes well with you.For me,I'm also in the good health as well as in the strong spirit.NyoNyo,I surmise  you would be feel that something is needed when the school is closed and we do not need to attend school any more.Well,I wanna tell about my retrospect of my school-year and philosophy in this letter.
          To begin with,I'm absolutely satisfied with my action of taking a risk:forfeiting the study time of Myanmar & replacing it with English.My decision may be a bit weird.Yet,one thing I can sure of is that I never get remorse for it.On the other hand,I give up the dream of 'All D'.You know that people around us generally judge everything with cover and never with micro details.So,I may be thought to be lazy.Anyway,I really don't care of their views on me and I am the only one who know very much about my talent,ability and characteristics .Speaking of my judgement in study,memorizing the whole text book of Myanmar is meaningless for me,indeed.The reason is that I will not encounter again with this tedious thing.However,English isn't like this,my friend.Whether we like it or not,it is the language dominating the whole world .So,we can see it as a mighty device for conmunicating persons from overseas.By the way, what is your plan to do in this summer?You can give a call to me whenever ideas appear in your head.In addition,no matter how colossal your hardships ,I'm ready to offer you a hand in filling with my best to happen the best for you.After you went back to Mandalay,my heart have been feeling empty till now!I ,sometimes,crave for the moment of hanging out with you every each second.
       Well,let me close my letter here.I'm really sorry for being a completely         ignoramus when it comes to K-pop.Let my word be turned to a nightingale    that will send my wish to you.
                                                                                               your sincere friend,
                                                                                                                Bo Bo.
