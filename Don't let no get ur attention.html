                If we were asked  which era we live at this moment,we would definitely answer that we are living in the era of digits.Most of gadgets,devices & tools around us are digital things owing to being composed of the digital system.Besides,the explosion of math advances leads us to the age of today astonishingly.Calculas,Linear Algebra,Vector,etc ,which are the 
             derivatives of that explosion,are very accurate as well as helpful to us.Moreover,we can apply them in the comfort of our own knowledge.In a way that,digit plays a pivotal stage in this world.Otherwise,these technology are so precise that make people of today sensitive.As a result,the soul of being human disappears in our heart.Thereby,the colours of love,kindness,joy become gradually dim.
                  First thing first,numbers can never judge everything even though they never lie.What I mean is that, love,repsect,hatred,just to mention a few ,cannot be measured with this numbers.Although we know that numbers obliquely tell us solutions of problems ,they are not able to  give response to control things mentioned above.The reason is that number being number and human being human.Additionally,score may lies at some very moments.No matter how clever a student is,an accident during examination period can makes his marks down.What is worse,a dull one can get a good grade with the help of fortune by cheating.Therefore,upshot ,sometimes,can be  inversely proportional to the truth:their competence.At second, take the 2013 advertisement of Nike-"Risk Everything".In that ads,C.ronaldo,ribery,Andres iniesta,W.rooney,Neymar,Z.Ibrahimovic, have their own weak points despite of being best footballers of this planet.Before so long,scientists created robotic footballers which are perfect as well as flawless.Humans were defated by robots at their first match,and then,they became downhearted .However,the power of will made them bounce back .At second leg,they played with the style of "risk everything" which made robotic footballers confused.In the end, they got a sweet victory.You may have  beef with me due to the development of AI even in the field of art.For me,art is a metaphor to describe what kind of people we are.Actually speaking,some arts created by AI are just the combinations of the previous arts created by humans.Factually,we,human beings,are only one kind of creature on this world which are full of creative ideas.
                  To cut the long story short,being humans ,we can do mistakes-even blunders.Somehow,we must become stronger tomorrow by learning from our mistakes and failures.A person who has never done even a mistake is the one who has done nothing.We have opportunities to create  our own better version ever than before with the help of data and details.Yet,we ought to care ourselves in order not to get lost in the number:the area of productivity and risk shortage.According to the slogan,"Yesterday is a history.Tomorrow is a mystery.Today is a gift",we should bravely take risk and taste the ups and downs of life with the heart of phoenix.
