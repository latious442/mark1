                Whether we have a dream to study abroad or take the overseas vacation,we need to be proficient in foreign languages -especially English- at all costs.The role of linguistics becomes more necessary day by day .As a proof,we can check the number of  candidates in university of foreign language and the embassy employees.Long time ago,learning a language is assumed for geniuses since there were very few linguistic resources,which makes learners mind-blowing .Somehow,in 1995,quite a few internet companies were born in Silicon valley with the dot com-bubble boom.Consequently,software as well as data-base have being held some of the great sections over the world since then.Thanks to this boom,many applications that translate the word are available around the clock .
              Nowadays,we can find the meaning of word which we do not know on the search box of translation application by tapping the keyboard at our convenience,lo and behold.Back to the old days,exploring the denotation of  merely a word in the dictionary takes time:at least,about one minute.Nevertheless,we can do it within 15 seconds with the aid of these applications .What is better,almost all translation applications are free which is cost-effective.
              To look at the downsides of language translation  applications,it obliquely forces the redundancy of linguistic teachers.Besides,too much relying on these applications gets learners wrong in the long-run.To put it in a nutshell,there are two roles:input & output  and four skills:reading,writing,listening and speaking in each language.The fact that over-using of translation application  slow downs the recalling rate of the definitions of the words which push  ones  to meet the obstacles in output section -especially in speaking skill.One important point we need to bear in mind is that language translation applications can only translate  the words.What I mean is that using those softwares for beginners is really in trouble learning language.Although the denotation of some words are the same,there is a bit of gap among them.For instance,frank and tactless are nearly indentical.However,frank is a positive one and tactless is a negative one.That misunderstanding can ,sometimes, encourages the conflict unintentionally.According to the psychological fact,we,humans donot care and can handily forget what we get effortlessly.So,we might slip words which we searched via language translation application in our memory.
              On the whole,all,including this kind of application,go hand in hand.Like uranium,the perfect users on these ones will surely obtain infinite benefits.If never have these application appeared,learning  the languages definitely would have been dull.Be that as it may,its pros are more than its cons and  credulously,using online language translation applications are one of the ideal ways to learn the languages.
