             </h1>
            <h3>
                In this era of today,most people are becoming happy-go-lucky due to their abused action of technology advancement.Unfortunately,they unintentionally abandon their  potential by living in the comfort as well as indolent area .According to the fiscal lists,even though their salary and income sound fair enough, the opportunities to climb the next level become gradually dim.Thereby,their lives will get tedious and be shaped into a boring system after good thing comes to an end.To achieve a ladder to reach an excited one ,we must keep learning all the time.
              When it comes to this word:learning ,almost all people think of what they learned from the school;but,this is mot the exact one.To define learning, it is the sapphire composed of      experiences,languages,philosophy,history,databases,just to mention a few.What I mean is that it is learning in which there is a wide range of fields.To watch what we see in our eyes,learning might be way too impractical.To observe it with our forethought ,there is nothing that is more valuable than learning.If we study the habits of most succeed billionaires,Elon Musk ,who is the CEO of spaceX and tesla,the shareholder of solarcity, and  Jeff Bezos,the CEO of Amazon,both of them have the upbringing of keep learning .How they keep learning even they are billionaires is questionable.In reality,they read many sorts of books:encyclopedia,biography,etc.Moreover,they have courage to ask even their employees what they do not know.For example,Elon frequently asked the engineer of his company about the structure of rocket .
           "Getting success is good but easy.Yet, Keeping success is hard and the best".Behind these two lines, the deep philosophy  is covered.Generally,people stop learning when their dreams come true .With the bending of clockwise and the passing of time,theirs reach to other dimension amd they will never come back .The second one seems humble and energetic."Keeping success " tells us to find our weak points and make them stronger. The second one seems humble and energetic.In life,not lasting forever is the only lasting thing.To get the exceptional life,we,sometimes,must roll the dice of life.
