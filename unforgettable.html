                We know that humans live on the earth is  a undeniable truth.Yet,for me,the fact that they live in their own world is more generally suitable.What I mean is that,despite of living on this planet,our mind and soul are in the wonderland of our own imaginations.Since I am the type of person having the heart of emotions,moments and memories sound precious as well as important for me.Whether they make me overjoyed or hurt,my brain is always holding them tightly even without my intention and permission.Whenever I recall my past moments,I feel that some are exhilarating,morbid,etc.When it comes to the meaning of unforgettable,most recognize their first touch on prosperity.Being an extraordinary one,I favor a different moment rather than them.
               At the start of a  story,as the marticulation exam is regarded as an important turning point in life,I buckled down to study as much as I can.Owing to being keen on learning computer science,I  need to get good rankings in both Math and English.Not only had I been indolent but had also been disobedient the previous school year.Therefore,I had some obstacles.Although I understand the meaning of English words and sentences,I couldnot innovate my  English_I couldnot write   essays and       letter well.Fortunately,there are some students who are adept at English.My aim is to have a good command of English rather than a good grade.So,I commenced to borrow their written essay books and observe their prowess on English meticulously.Moreover,I requested one of the smartest students:Kaung Htet Hein to analyze my essays and pinpoint weak points of them.Frankly speaking,I learned myriad ideas how to do brainstorming,new vocabularies, patterns,slogans from him.What is funny,whenever an object appeared in my mind,I always asked  the meaning of it and how should I apply this in my essay.With his amazing patience,he always articulated and elaborated me in details what I asked .Absolutely,did I devote my time to studying English.Then,I became  friends with clever guys like YeeZarHtun,AungKhantHtoo,KaungKhantKyaw,ZinLinHtun,LwimMinHein,SaiLinnHtetAung.I analyzed their essays and emulated their strengths.After December exam,an incident which my investment are worthy and succeed to an extent arrived.To put it in a nutshell,my essay and letter written in exam was regarded as the standard ones.I had never dared to imagine that condition.The main reason is that even though my English was improving ,my friends' English were extremely stronger  than mine.In my opinion,my essay was not the best.Maybe,it was the most appropriate to be be assumed as a sample essay.With the passing of time,after we had written an essay ,we read our essays conversely.I think that moment  looks like the time after a football match finished.To simplify,the footballers give other their own shirts and take others in return as a memory.In English study, we conferred about vocabularies which should be used and how to create the infallible flow in writing.
                        I am sure that I never think of my progress like this at the first school-day of grade-12.In the end of a day,we outperformed in almost all subjects and the unforgettable era of my own world ,that I cannot touch it again ,ended with exchanging our phone numbers and signatures.
