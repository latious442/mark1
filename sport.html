                To have better quality of life,a person needs not to be fragile.Nowadays,there are many advices that keep us fit.Among them,we ought to consider sport as a pill bringing the delighted life to us.It is sport that is aesthetically everything -science,art,the birthplace of sportsmanship.Unless sport existed,our life would get absolutely  bored.In fact,sport strengthens both body and mind.It ,sometimes, might teach us what was not taught to us in school;especially,the harmony of teamwork,the gap of between victory and defeat.That is why most people from Europe Continent regard sport as one which is more than a hobby.
          If  I had to choose merely one sort of sports,I would select chess.Before I go to the point,let me clarify my mindset.Mine is like a nerd's one   since  I immensely attend to thing in which  my interest flows.Yet,mine is indifferent towards becoming-popular something ,that I used to enjoy once upon a time.Speaking of the main point,the performance of a chess player can be effortlessly rated thanks to the pro of chess engine.On the one hand,others sports such as football,volleyball are  a bit  puzzled to judge whether a player is good or bad.As they are group-games ,no matter how exceptional a player is,the trophy is not sure for him when his team is in a poor form.On the other hand,chess is simple.What I mean is that if a player is not competent enough to obtain a sweet victory,here is only a failure for him.This sport never relies on the luck.
       The bright side of chess has myriad advantages.First of all,it appeases you owing being an intensive game.Thereby,your emotions will get lost in chess.At second,it boosts our IQ majestically.This fact is undisputable due to  the record that world chess champions :Fischer,Kasparov,Carlsen have insanely high score of IQ-around 160.The reason is that our brain links up neuron cells while we are playing it.Moreover,it enhances our memory,concentration as well as also creativity.Thirdly,it tells us not to be stubborn,arrogant.During a match,we are supposed to resign by the time our rival has more materials,better strategy for the sake our respect to his brilliance.Mentioned-above strengths offer a good lifestyle.For instance,Anatoly Karpov(a former world chess champion of form 1975 up to 1985)became a successful Russian politician with the support of his fame and idea.
A chess board has 64 squares and 32 materials.To describe precisely,each side has 16 materials of 5 different sorts.They are a king,a queen,a couple of bishops,knights,rooks and also eight pawns.
A pawn can be every material what you want when it reaches the back door of the opponent.It moves straight and attack enemies diagonally.As an exception,it can move two squares at its first move.The bishop moves as well as fights diagonally as far as there is no material in its way.The knight moves and destroys rivals with L-move .Like a bishop,a rook can move but its motions is like the syntax of plus.The movement of queen is a combination of rook and bishop;yet,the king can move around only a square.By the time a king is trapped,we lost regardless of the amount of materials.Quality being better than quantity in this game ,it makes us astounded.
Overall,despite of lack of physical movement,it can upgrade our ideology .What is better, physical appearance does not matter in this game.For me,this type of sport is similar to writing an essay as we need to know some pattern and logic before it gets started.After all, creativity ignite to give us a sweet achievement.The probability of these two things becomes like the number of infinite stars in  the galaxy slow and steady.
